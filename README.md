# Fitness Training App

## Project Overview

This Fitness Training App aims to be a web application designed to empower users with personalized workout and nutrition tracking. 
The application facilitates the creation of custom workout programs, exercise logging, diet tracking, and progress monitoring, aiming to support users in achieving their fitness goals effectively.

## Project Status

This project is currently in active development. Features are being added and refined to enhance user experience and functionality. 
As a solo full-stack developer, I am leveraging my skills in both frontend and backend technologies to build a comprehensive solution for fitness enthusiasts.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Django REST Framework
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Authentication:** Django REST Framework JWT for secure user authentication
- **Styling:** CSS3
  
## In Development Features
- **User Management:** Sign up, sign in, and user profile management.
- **Workout Programs:** Users can create, edit, and manage personalized workout programs.
- **Exercise Logging:** Detailed logging of exercises including sets, reps, and weights.
- **Flexible Programming Options:** Introducing micro, meso, and macro cycles for sport-specific training logs, providing users with advanced program creation tools for structured scheduling.
- **Enhanced Workout Logging:** Gym and running loggers with detailed scheduling systems, including exercise specifics like superset functionalities, intensity parameters, and session segment labeling.
- **Dynamic Exercise Database:** A more flexible exercise selection that isn't limited to equipment type, encouraging users to focus on movements rather than specific tools.
- **User Role Expansion:** Extending functionalities to support coaches in creating and managing training programs for trainees, and enabling admin roles with broader management capabilities.
- **Interactive Muscle Map:** An innovative feature that visualizes muscle engagement in real time, offering a completion percentage for each muscle group targeted during workouts to help users achieve balanced training.
- **Smart Programming Selections:** Leveraging the muscle map for smart workout planning, automatically suggesting exercises to ensure comprehensive coverage of all muscle groups for balanced development.

## Future Features
- **Advanced Metrics Tracking:** Expanded logging options including body measurements, detailed diet tracking with caloric and macro tracking, and sport-specific data entry for comprehensive progress tracking.
- **On-the-Go Program Creation:** Enabling users to quickly create single-day workout plans on the fly, perfect for spontaneous gym sessions without the need for long-term planning.
- **Enhanced Set Categories:** Introducing categorization for sets (e.g., warmup, main, cool down) to allow users to structure their workouts more effectively and according to their training phase.
- **Progressive User Interface Enhancements:** Continuous improvements to the app's UI/UX to make navigation, data entry, and progress tracking more intuitive and user-friendly.
